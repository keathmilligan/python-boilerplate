Python Project Boilerplate
==========================

This repo provides a standardized template for modern Python projects based
on the layout [recommended by Kenneth Reitz](http://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/repository-structure-and-python).

This version adds:
* Support for installing development dependencies through setup.py
* PyTest unit-test support
* An [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file
* Sphinx documentation generation through setup.py
